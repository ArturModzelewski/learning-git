            Lipstick junkie
            Debunked the all in one
            She came back wearing a smile

            Looking like someone drugged me
            That wanted to unplug me
            No one here is on trial
            It's just a turnaround
            And we go, oh
            Well, then we go uh, uh, uh, uh
            
            Tick-tock, I want to rock you like the '80s
            Cock blocking isn't allowed
            
            Tugboat Sheila is into memorabilia
            Who said three is a crowd
            We better get it on the go
            
            Hey now
            We've got to make it rain somehow
            She told me to
            And showed me what to do
            How Maggie makes it in her cloud
            
            I said, hey now
            We've got to make it rain somehow
            She told me to
            And showed me what to do
            She knows how to make it loud
            
            Rain dance Maggie
            Advances to the final
            Who knew that she had the goods
            
            Little did I know
            Her body was one delicious vinyl
            To your neck of the woods
            I want to lick a little bit
            
            Hey now
            We've got to make it rain somehow
            She told me to
            And showed me what to do
            How Maggie makes it in her cloud
            
            We've got the wrong girl
            But not for long, girl
            It's in the song, girl
            'Cause I'll be gone, girl
            
            Hey now
            We've got to make it rain somehow
            She told me to
            And showed me what to do
            How Maggie makes it in her cloud
            
            I said, hey now
            I want to rock this rowdy crowd
            She told me to
            And showed me what to do
            She knows how to make it loud
            
            But not for long, girl
            It's in the song, girl
            'Cause I'll be gone, bye-bye-bye, yeah
            Bye-bye-bye, girl
            
            Bye-bye, girl
            Bye-bye, girl
            Bye-bye
